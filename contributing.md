##1 Contributing to an existing Project
**Situation**: You want changes you've made to a project to be included in its master branch.

1. Read the project's README.md. 
2. If there is an active maintainer, contact the maintainer and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If there is no maintainer, feel free to [email us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) to become the new maintainer.

##2 Adding a Project
**Situation**: You've got a project you'd like to add.

Awesome!
1. Create a Git respository and upload the source code. Feel free to host it anywhere.
2. Choose an open source license and add it to your project. We recommend using the Apache, MIT, BSD, or Eclipse Public License.
3. [Tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) the commit you would like included.
4. [Email us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) a link to your repository and the tag of the commit you wish to be considered.
5. We'll review your project and make sure it meets the [Community Standards](CommunityStandards.md). We will then let you know either
  1. your project was approved,
  2. what you need to do to get your project approved, or
  3. why we cannot include your project in Watson Catalyst.
6. Once approved, we will add your project to Catalyst.

##3 Releasing a Project Update
**Situation**: You already have a project in Catalyst and would like the new release to be included in Catalyst.

1. [Tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) the specific commit of the release.
2. [Email us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) the tag you would like us to point to. 

##4 Getting OSSC Approval
**Situation**: You are the maintainer of a project which does not have OSSC approval, but would like IBMers to be able to contribute to your project.

1. [Contact us](ostools@us.ibm.com) and let us know you'd like IBMers to be able to contribute to your project.
2. We will work with IBM's Open Source Steering Committee to get approval. If any changes need to be made to your project, we will let you know.
