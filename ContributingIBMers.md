#Contributing to Watson Catalyst
**If you are an IBMer, feel free to contribute to any Catalyst project. Ignore the rest of this document for now.**

---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Watson Catalyst! If you are not an IBMer, [see here](Contributing.md).

##1 Contributing to an existing Project
**Situation**: You want changes you've made to a project to be included in its master branch.

1. Check [the OSSC approval lists](OSSC.md). If the project has been approved, you may continue.
2. Read the project's README.md. 
3. If there is an active maintainer, contact the maintainer and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If there is no maintainer, feel free to [email us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) to become the new maintainer.

##2 Getting OSSC Approval for a non-IBMer Project
**Situation**: You would like to contribute to a Catalyst project, but it has not yet been approved by the OSSC.

1. Read the project's README.md and contact the maintainer.
2. If either the project has no active maintainer or the maintainer does not want to seek OSSC approval, fork the project and seek OSSC approval for it as your own project.
3. [Let us know](ostools@us.ibm.com) which project you'd like to contribute to.
4. We'll work with the maintainer to get OSSC approval.

##3 Getting OSSC Approval for Your Project
**Situation**: You've got a project you would like to add to Catalyst, but it does not yet have OSSC approval.

1. Create a private repository on [JazzHub](hub.jazz.net) and upload the source code.
2. Choose an open source license. We strongly recommend the Apache License. This is the open source license IBM is most comfortable working with.
3. [Contact us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) and let us know about your project.
4. We will get your project in on the OSSC's biweekly meeting.
5. We will let you know if either your project was approved or if you need to make changes to your project to get it approved.

This is the process for now. As we work with the OSSC, we will develop an expedited process.

##4 Adding an OSSC-approved Project
1. Create a Git respository and upload the source code. Feel free to host it anywhere.
2. [Tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) the commit you would like included.
3. [Email us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) a link to your repository and the tag of the commit you wish to be considered.
4. We'll review your project and make sure it meets the [Community Standards](CommunityStandards.md). We will then let you know either
  1. your project was approved,
  2. what you need to do to get your project approved, or
  3. why we cannot include your project in Watson Catalyst.
5. Once approved, we will add your project to Catalyst.

##5 Releasing a Project Update
**Situation**: You already have a project in Catalyst and would like the new release to be included in Catalyst.

1. [Tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) the specific commit of the release.
2. [Email us](mailto:ostools@us.ibm.com) the tag you would like us to point to.
