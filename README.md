#Watson Catalyst
Watson Catalyst is an open source community for the development of extensions on the Watson platform to enable and accelerate the development of applications using Watson services. 

**Mission**  
To empower and engage people to collaboratively develop open source software which
* augments Watson's capability,
* makes it easier develop Watson apps, and
* does cool things with Watson.

**Vision**  
A world where people collaboratively solve problems using Watson.

##1 Structure
Watson Catalyst is a community of independent open source projects. Each project is governed independently, but is held to certain standards of licensing, documentation, code style, and functionality.

###1.1 Licensing
Watson Catalyst is licensed under the MIT License. To be included in the community, a project must use a non-copyleft open source license. We recommend the MIT, Apache, and BSD licenses since these are easy for IBMers to contribute to.

###1.2 Documentation
Projects must have documentation including the following:
- [ ] a description of what the project does,
- [ ] step-by-step installation instructions,
- [ ] a working example with input and expected output,
- [ ] a roadmap of future developments, and
- [ ] an email for the maintainer of the project.

The project maintainer is responsible for responding to pull requests, documentation inquiries, and bug reports. The project maintainer is not responsible for contributing code or fixing bugs.

###1.3 Code Style
Projects may be written in any language. If a project's language is in the [Google Style Guide](https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/), the project should conform to those standards. 

###1.4 Functionality
Projects must do what they say they do. For example, if a project claims to upload questions to an instance, it should include a working example file to upload.

##2 Using a Tool
Each project in Watson Catalyst comes with documentation and working examples to get you started. See the README.md located in the project's main directory. If something doesn't work, contact the project's maintainer. You can find the maintainer's contact information in the project's README.md.

##3 Projects List
* [QImport](QImport/README.md) - upload a CSV of questions to an instance

###3.1 Coming Soon
* Credentials - a library for handling Watson instance credentials
* WEA Toolkit - a set of browser-based tools for managing corpora and ground truth
