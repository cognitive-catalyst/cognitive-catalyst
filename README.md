#Watson Catalyst
An open source community for the development of extensions on the Watson platform to enable and accelerate the development of applications using Watson services. 

This document is a draft - information in it is subject to change in major ways as we figure out what we want this community to look like at launch.

##Quick Start
*See also: [Quick Start](QuickStart.md)*

If you just want to download projects but not contribute, you can easily get all available projects by downloading the Catalyst repository. You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. Note that this may take considerable time and space. See the full article for other options.

Launch a terminal or Git Bash. In your directory of choice, enter
```
git clone path/to/repo
cd WatsonCatalyst
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
This will get you the most recent Catalyst releases of every project. Whenever you want to ensure you have the latest versions of every project, run
```
git pull path/to/repo
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

##Structure
