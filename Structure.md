###2.1 Catalyst
This repository, Catalyst, contains the latest releases of all linked projects, a description of the Watson Catalyst project, and legal documents. 

###2.2 Projects
Each project falls into one of two categories, IBM-led and external-led. External-led projects may be started at any time by non-IBMers and hosted anywhere, but they must conform to the Catalyst Community Standards for the Catalyst repository to include them. For IBMers to contribute to external-led projects, we have an internal process to approve projects.

###2.3 Moderators
Moderators (listed at the end of this document) govern the community. They resolve disputes, accept new projects and releases, and liaison with IBM Watson teams. For now IBM will appoint moderators, but we intend the community to hold elections in early 2016 to elect new ones.
