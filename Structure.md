#Structure

##Code

###The Catalyst Repository
Catalyst contains the latest releases of all linked projects, a description of the Watson Catalyst project, and legal documents.


###Projects
Each project falls into one of two categories, IBM-led and external-led. The only notable difference between the two is how IBMers get permission to contribute to the project. All projects must conform to the [Community Standards](CommunityStandards.md).

Linked projects are included as [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in the Catalyst repository.

###IBM-Led Projects
IBM-led projects are maintained by IBMers. They are approved by the Open Source Steering Committee before release.

###External-Led Projects
External-led projects may be started at any time by non-IBMers and hosted anywhere. For IBMers to contribute they need OSSC approval, but otherwise

##People
The Catalyst community is composed of several groups of people with varying functions and responsibilities.

###Users
Anyone who uses a Catalyst project is a user. They submit bug reports, feature requests, and participate in conversations about projects. They are free to clone and branch projects, but their contributions may not be included in Catalyst unless they have a Watson Catalyst CLA on file.

###Contributors
Contributors are anyone who has a signed Watson Catalyst CLA on file. Their contributions may be included in any Catalyst project. They may launch new projects under the condition that they become the project's maintainer.

###Maintainers
Contributors who own a project are called project maintainers. They are responsible for ensuring their project meets the Community Standards. In brief, this means they
- Resolve bug reports
- Respond to general inquiries/feature requests
- Evaluate and accept pull requests

If a project currently has maintainers, they may accept new ones.

###Moderators
Moderators govern the community. They resolve disputes, accept new projects and releases, and liaison with IBM Watson teams. For now IBM will appoint moderators, but we intend the community to hold elections to elect new ones.
