#Creating a New Project (IBMers)
Thanks for wanting to create a new project for Catalyst! If you are not an IBMer, see [New Projects](NewProjects.md).

##Repository Name Guidelines
You don't have to follow these if you don't want to, but they do make it easier to work with your repository.
- use lower case
- use dashes to separate words
- be specific (so you can differentiate between similar ideas)
- be consistent (think about how you'll find your repository later)

##Creating your Repository
1. Send [joshua.hall@us.ibm.com](mailto:joshua.hall@us.ibm.com) the name you want your repository to have.
2. Joshua Hall will create your repository and let you know when it's ready. You'll be added as an admin of that repository.

Also please review the IBM guidelines here for securing the appropriate approval. (https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W783ba5fa6c1a_40b3_945a_07d0eb0115bd/page/Posting%20Samples%20%26%20Product%20usage%20Examples)

##Getting your project in Catalyst
1. Ensure the project is compliant with [Community Standards](CommunityStandards.md).
2. Once you've been approved as an Admin on the project repository. Push any updates to the repository as any you would with any GitHub project.

If you have questions, feel free to ask them in a comment or an email to [joshua.hall@us.ibm.com](mailto:joshua.hall@us.ibm.com).

##Committing Rules
For Catalyst, we're using a [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) to make sure all code additions to the repository are licensed properly. Here's the procedure we've come up with:

1. Do not commit directly to the `master` branch of your project.
2. Create a branch of your own and commit to it as you wish.
3. To get changes onto the `master` branch, do so with a pull request.
4. Include the line `DCO 1.1 Signed-off-by: {Full Name} <{email address}>` (without the {}) at the bottom of your pull request message or in the comments section of each major commit.

If you forget to include the DCO line, note that you can edit the pull request even after it's been closed.
